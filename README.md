# Linkedin-Graph-Neural-Networks-Project
This a personal project created by Alexander Quesada Quesada, the goal is to simulate Linkedin job postings as nodes in a graph and create edges between nodes that satisfy specific requierments, those connections represent similarity between two jobs, and they will also have weights from 0 to 1 representing the strength of that similarity.
